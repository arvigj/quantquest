INTRODUCTION
============
	1. Importance of Data Science in Investment Banking
		+ Rising need to structure unstructured data
		+ To better understand the sentiment of companies
		+ Utlize data science techniques for pattern recognition
		+ Understand the customers better
		+ Attempt finding patterns that would help identify frauds

	2. Why build a matrix?
		+ Gain some insight into the S&P 500 without looking at strucutred data sources
		+ Portfolio Diversification Matrix
		+ How accurate is the data that is available on wikipedia which is one of the most widely used to-go source of information

	
METHODOLOGY/APPROACH/MODEL
==========================
	DATA MINING
	1. General Approach
		+ Strength of the matrix in 2 parameters - Hyperlinks and Industry/Sub-Industry categories
		//Decription of Each Factor
		+ Linkage
			* Explanation of Page Rank
			* Looking at each company in singularity the links that are going out of the page give us most information
			* Take a screenshot and explain what you mean
		+ Industry & Sub-Industry
			* Explain how this essentially helps us narrow down the categories
			* Explain how it is not just "industries" in the broad sense but it gets rather specific
			* Take a screenshot and give example

	2. Technical Appraoch
		+ Links
			* We used the wikipedia api to get all the links that were going out from each of the pages
			* Essentially, iterated over all the pages for this
			* Stored the data in dictionaries so that lookup time reduces and efficiency increases when building the logic
		+ Industry
			* We try to get these details from the categories of each of the companies.
			* We are not looking for specific details of the company such as sub industries as well.
			* Give example - (Nanotechnology falls under Technology but it is still included)

	DATA LOGIC
	1. General Appraoch
		+ Explanation of the Graph Model
			* Explain the Algorithm


	2. Technical Appraoch
		+ Links
			* We check for matches between each of the two companies
			* This is a simple iterative check - as the link names would not require any hardcore NLP (just to save up)
			  on time and efficiency
			* Apply the graph model
			* Give an example (diagram/draw)
		+ Industry
			* Usage of NLP (This part is highly time consuming)
			* Comparing the industry names for each of the companies by using semantic analysis
			* We used semantic analysis here because not all industries are "exactly" the same but
			  there is a strong similarity relation between "nanotechnology" company and a "technology" company
